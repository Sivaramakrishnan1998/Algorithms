// Given N numbers, the program must print the longest increasing subset from the end.
//  If multiple subsets are present with the same longest length print the first occurring subset.

// Input Format:
// The first line contains N.
// The second line contains N numbers separated by space.

// Output Format:
// The first line contains the longest increasing subset.

// Boundary Conditions:
// 2 <= N <= 9999
// Value of a given number is from -99999 to 99999

// Example Input/Output 1:
// Input:
// 8
// 2 18 18 11 6 17 11 4

// Output:
// 4 11 17

// Explanation:
// There are two subsets which are of increasing values and of length 3 from the end - 4 11 17 and 6 11 18.
// As 4 11 17 appears first (from the end) it is printed as the output.
